# Student Grade Generator
It's an input/output program.

# Description
The user inputs a value based on the Arrays assigned in the prompt case and the input is stored in the mark varable and converts it to an interger using the `parseInt()`.
The code evaluates the mark entered is within range.If not an error will be displayed using`console.log()`
If the mark entered is within range, the code proceeds to evaluate the corresponding grade based on the mark using a `switch` statement.
The `switch (true)` statement is used to evaluate each `case`.
Depending on the value of `mark`, the code assigns appropriate grade to the `grade` variable inside each `case`
Finally the determined grade is displayed to the user using `console.log()`.
